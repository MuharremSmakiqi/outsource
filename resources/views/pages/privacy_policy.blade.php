        <h6>HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA WE HOLD ABOUT YOU</h6>

    <p>We may process your personal data for purposes necessary for the performance of our contract with you OR your
        employer OR our clients.</p>
    <p>We may process your personal data in order to comply with our legal obligation. This may include processing your
        personal data especially where you are an employee, subcontractor, supplier or customer of our business partner.
    </p>
    <p>We may process your personal data for the purposes of our own legitimate interests provided that those interests
        do not override any of your own interests, rights and freedoms which require the protection of personal data.
        This includes processing for business development, statistical and management purposes within our group of
        companies.</p>
    <p>Should you subscribe to our newsletter, we will process your personal data based on your consent, in order to
        keep you informed and up to date with regards to our activity and / or legal developments that may have an
        impact on your activity.</p>
    <p>Please note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful basis depending on the specific
        purpose for which we are using your data.</p>
    <p>Situations in which we will use your personal data</p>
    <p>We may use your personal data in order to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>carry out our obligations arising from any agreements entered into between you OR your employer OR our
            clients and us (which will most usually be for the provision of our services);</li>
        <li>carry out our obligations arising from any agreements entered into between our clients and us (which will

            our client;</li>
        <li>provide you with information related to our services and our events and activities that you request from us
            or which we feel may interest you, provided you have consented to be contacted for such purposes;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>seek your thoughts and opinions on the services we provide</li>
        <li>notify you about any changes to our services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise or pseudonymise the personal data so that it can no longer be associated
        with you, in which case we may use it without further notice to you.</p>
    <p>If you refuse to provide us with certain information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract
        we have entered into with you, nor will it be possible for us to answer any inquires you may have.
        Alternatively, we may be unable to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.</p>

    <h6>Data retention</h6>
    <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it is
        collected.</p>
    <p>When assessing what retention period is appropriate for your personal data, we take into consideration:</p>

        <li>the requirements of our business and the services provided;</li>
        <li>any statutory or legal obligations;</li>
        <li>the purposes for which we originally collected the personal data;</li>
        <li>the lawful grounds on which we based our processing;</li>
        <li>the types of personal data we have collected;</li>
        <li>the amount and categories of your personal data; and</li>
        <li>whether the purpose of the processing could reasonably be fulfilled by other means.</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Change of purpose</h6>
    <p>Where we need to use your personal data for another reason, other than for the purpose for which we collected it,
        we will only use your personal data where that reason is compatible with the original purpose.</p>
    <p>Should it be necessary to use your personal data for a new purpose, we will notify you and communicate the legal
        basis which allows us to do so before starting any new processing.</p>

        <h6>DATA SHARING</h6>

    <p>Why might you share my personal data with third parties?</p>
    <p>We will share your personal data with third parties where we are required by law, where it is necessary to
        administer the relationship between us or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so.</p>
    <p>Which third-party service providers process my personal data?</p>
    <p>“Third parties” includes third-party service providers and members of our firm’s network. The following
        activities are carried out by third-party service providers: IT and cloud services, professional advisory
        services, administration services, marketing services and banking services.</p>
    <p>All of our third-party service providers are required to take commercially reasonable and appropriate security
        measures to protect your personal data. We only permit our third-party service providers to process your
        personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
    <p>What about other third parties?</p>
    <p>We may share your personal data with other third parties, for example in the context of the possible sale or
        restructuring of the business. We may also need to share your personal data with a regulator or to otherwise
        comply with the law.</p>

        <h6>TRANSFERRING PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA)</h6>
        <h6>DATA SECURITY</h6>

    <p>We have put in place commercially reasonable and appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from
        being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit
        access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business
        need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
        confidentiality.</p>
    <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any
        applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

        <h6>RIGHTS OF ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE, AND RESTRICTION</h6>

    <p>Your duty to inform us of changes</p>
    <p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Should your personal
        information change, please notify us of any changes of which we need to be made aware by contacting us, using
        our contact details.</p>
    <p>Your rights in connection with personal data</p>
    <p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive details of the personal data we hold about
            you and to check that we are processing it lawfully.</li>
        <li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where
            there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
            remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
        <li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
            third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
            processing on this basis. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal
            information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
        <li>Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
            processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason
            for processing it.</li>
        <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or another data controller if the processing is based on
            consent, carried out by automated means and this is technically feasible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to exercise any of the above rights, please email our data protection point of
        contact&nbsp;<u>datagdpr@gsiassociates.com</u>.</p>
    <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we
        may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may
        refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</p>
    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
        access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure
        to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
    <p>You also have the right to file a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory
        authority for data protection issues, at any time. The ICO’s contact details are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the limited circumstances where we process your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to
        withdraw it for that specific processing at any time and with no negative consequences. To withdraw your
        consent, please email our data protection point of contact&nbsp;<a
            href="mailto:datagdpr@gsiassociates.com">datagdpr@gsiassociates.com</a></p>
    <p>Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your personal
        information (personal data) for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another
        legitimate basis for doing so in law.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>USE OF SOCIAL SHARING</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use plugins for the respective social media services for social sharing functionalities. Instead, we
        merely set a text or graphics link. These do not transmit any data, such as your IP address, browser used,
        screen resolution, websites viewed, date and time, to the respective social media services.</p>
    <p>These links look something like this: https://twitter.com/gsiassociates</p>
    <p>If you click on a social sharing link while logged into your respective social media account, you can share the
        contents of our pages on your profile. This allows the social media service to assign your visit to our pages to
        your user account. Please note that as the provider of the pages, we are informed of neither the content of the
        transmitted data nor their use by the respective social media.</p>
