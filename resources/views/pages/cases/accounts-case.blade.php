			One of the company’s directors deals with all day to day financial management but they wanted somebody at
			 “bookkeeper” level to deal with data entry and reconciliation.  
			  They did not want somebody coming to their home office and working in various site offices was not appropriate for accounts.

			We recruited a young and energetic accountant in our Pristina office, with strong experience in QuickBooks online and the desktop version, 
			from which our client was just migrating. 
	       He was able to provide significant support during the migration as well as subsequent training for their director.

		   He deals with all day to day data entry, bank reconciliations, and issuing credit control reports.  
		   We provided training for CIS (HMRC’s construction Industry Scheme) and he is an integral part of the staff of our client. <br>
           An employee of this level of competence and dedication would be highly welcomed in UK but their costs are less than half UK salary rates for somebody of an equivalent level.
